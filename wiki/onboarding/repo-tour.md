# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Closed network deployment:** Production runs in closed, air-gapped network environments with no public internet access. All dependencies must be self-hosted or bundled. Do not introduce external CDN links, public API calls, or any runtime fetches to public URLs.

**Keep this file updated:** Whenever you add features, change architecture, add/remove dependencies, or modify config — update this file and the relevant per-app `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the current state. The `README.md` must also be updated to stay accurate.

## Monorepo Structure

pnpm + Turborepo monorepo. Workspace root is `apps/*` and `packages/*`.

```
apps/
  frontend/    — Vite + React 19 + React Router v7 (port 3000)
  server/      — Fastify + Node.js (port 4000)
  iframe-demo/ — Angular 21 demo harness for iframe integration (port 8080)
  core-mock/   — Fastify mock of the Core service (port 8002)
  mock-vod/    — Fastify mock of the VOD service (port 5050)
packages/
  contract/         — shared postMessage + AMQP event contract (@video-editor/contract)
  observability/    — OpenTelemetry + Pino + Pyroscope toolkit (@ztube/observability)
```

`core-mock` and `mock-vod` coordinate via `POST /__internal/register-token` so cross-service `vod-token` trust mirrors the real Core/VOD relationship. See [docs/adr/0002-mock-vod-as-separate-app.md](docs/adr/0002-mock-vod-as-separate-app).

Per-app guidance:

- [apps/server/CLAUDE.md](apps/server/CLAUDE)
- [apps/iframe-demo/CLAUDE.md](apps/iframe-demo/CLAUDE)
- [apps/mock-vod/CLAUDE.md](apps/mock-vod/CLAUDE)
- [packages/contract/CLAUDE.md](packages/contract/CLAUDE)

## Repo Rules

- Server runtime is Node.js `22.18+`.
- Use `pnpm` for all package management. Add dependencies with `pnpm add` or `pnpm add -D`, and do not use `npm`.
- Use only imports with `.ts` and not `.js`.
- Server TypeScript is executed directly with Node.js. Do not introduce `tsx`/`ts-node` for normal app execution.
- After each completed prompt, run these checks before finishing:
  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  turbo run type-check
  pnpm test
  pnpm knip
  ```

## Development Philosophy

Prefer TDD: red → green → refactor. One test at a time, vertical slices only — never write all tests then all code.

- Write one failing test for one behavior, implement minimal code to pass, repeat.
- Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Tests must survive internal refactors.
- No mocking internal collaborators. Use real code paths.
- Run `/tdd` skill for guidance when building features or fixing bugs test-first.

## Commands

```bash
# Root — runs both apps in parallel via Turborepo
pnpm dev
pnpm lint
pnpm build

# Per-app
cd apps/frontend    && pnpm dev
cd apps/server      && pnpm dev    # node runs TypeScript directly in watch mode
cd apps/iframe-demo && pnpm dev    # Angular dev server on port 8080

# Type check
cd apps/frontend && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
cd apps/server   && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit

# Format (biome)
pnpm format

# Tests (Vitest)
cd apps/server && pnpm test   # vitest run
cd packages/contract && pnpm test   # builds then runs dist/**/*.test.js
```

## Local Dev Setup

MinIO (S3-compatible storage) and RabbitMQ must be running before the app works:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Configure `apps/server/.env`. Frontend needs no `.env` in dev. The server defaults to `http://localhost:4001`. Vite proxies `/render`, `/editor`, and `/upload` to it during local development. Uploads use the presigned-URL flow: client requests a signed URL from `/upload/signed-url`, then PUTs the file directly to MinIO on `http://localhost:9000` (MinIO CORS in `docker-compose.yml` allows `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:8080`).

**Optional frontend env:**
- `VITE_EDITOR_PARENT_ORIGINS` — comma-separated allowed origins for iframe postMessage (required when embedding the editor in an iframe).

## Architecture

### Frontend (`apps/frontend`)

Vite + React 19 SPA on port 3000. Core feature is `src/features/editor/` — the full video editing UI with scene canvas (Moveable/Selecto), timeline (`@designcombo/timeline`), Remotion `<Player>`, and per-type property panels. State via 8 Zustand stores. Supports iframe embedding via `useEditorPostMessage` hook.

→ See [apps/frontend/CLAUDE.md](apps/frontend/CLAUDE) for full detail.

### Server (`apps/server`)

Fastify + Node.js 22.18+. Two entrypoints, one image:

- **API** on port 4001 (`src/index.ts`) — HTTP only. Enqueues render commands on a RabbitMQ queue.
- **Worker** on probe port 8081 (`src/worker.ts`) — consumes the queue, runs FFmpeg, publishes lifecycle events.

Follows **hexagonal architecture** (Ports & Adapters): features live in `src/features/<name>/` with `adapters/inbound/{http,amqp}/`, `adapters/outbound/{ffmpeg,s3,amqp,http}/`, `application/use-cases/`, and `domain/`. Shared domain types and ports in `src/shared/`. Infrastructure adapters in `src/infrastructure/`.

Three features: `upload`, `render`, `preview`.

Routes (API):
| Method | Path | Feature |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/upload/signed-url` | upload |
| POST | `/render` | render — returns 202 `{ id }`; 503 if broker unavailable. No GET endpoint — clients track lifecycle via AMQP `export.*` events |
| POST | `/editor/preview-source` | preview |
| GET | `/editor/segment` | preview |
| GET | `/editor/demo-assets/:filename` | preview |

Worker manifests live in `deploy/worker/`. See [docs/adr/0005-render-worker-deployment.md](docs/adr/0005-render-worker-deployment).

→ See [apps/server/CLAUDE.md](apps/server/CLAUDE) for full detail.

### Iframe Demo (`apps/iframe-demo`)

Angular 21 standalone app on port 8080. Embeds `/editor/embed` in a floating, draggable/resizable iframe. Provides a control panel to send `EDITOR_ADD_PREVIEW_ITEM` and `EDITOR_CLEAR_PROJECT` messages and displays responses. Primary harness for testing the iframe integration.

→ See [apps/iframe-demo/CLAUDE.md](apps/iframe-demo/CLAUDE) for full detail.

### Package: contract (`packages/contract`)

Published as `@video-editor/contract`. Two sub-paths:
- `/iframe` — Zod schemas + types for the editor↔parent postMessage protocol.
- `/events` — versioned `Envelope<T>` + Zod schemas for AMQP events published to the `video-editor` topic exchange (`export.started`, `export.completed`, `export.failed`). External teams bind queues against this exchange and import schemas from `/events` for consumer-side validation.

Root export (`@video-editor/contract`) re-exports `iframe` + shared `SavedMediaItem`/`SavedMediaPayload`.

→ See [packages/contract/CLAUDE.md](packages/contract/CLAUDE) for full detail and [packages/contract/src/events/README.md](packages/contract/src/events/README) for the consumer onboarding doc.

## Key External Dependencies

- **`@designcombo/*`** — proprietary packages (state, timeline, transitions, animations, frames, events, types). Core to editor behavior.
- **Remotion** — video composition engine. `@remotion/player` renders the canvas preview in the browser.
- **`@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg`** — bundled FFmpeg binary (no system install needed). Server uses raw `spawn` for all FFmpeg processing.
- **`@fastify/multipart`** — file upload handling (500 MB limit).
- **`@ztube/observability`** — internal package providing OpenTelemetry tracing/metrics, Pino structured logging, and Pyroscope profiling for server + worker.

## Wiki

The `wiki/` folder at the repo root is the GitLab project wiki, shaped for the closed network. The operator copies its contents into the `<project>.wiki.git` repo by hand after each refresh.

- **Generated pages** (onboarding, architecture, ADRs, per-app/package READMEs) come from `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/adr/*.md`, `apps/*/README.md`, and `packages/*/README.md`. Source those files — never edit the generated wiki pages directly.
- **Hand-written pages** (everything under `wiki/integrators/`, `wiki/ops/`, `wiki/product/`) are edited directly in `wiki/`. The generator never touches them.

To refresh generated pages after editing any source:

```bash
pnpm wiki:build
```

The generator (`scripts/build-wiki.ts`) is idempotent. It tracks its outputs in `wiki/.generated.json` and only ever touches files listed there.
